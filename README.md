## Boolean Expressions

Recall that an **expression** is a combination of variables, operations and values that yields a resulting value, and that the primitive data type `boolean` stores **truth values** (`true` or `false`).

A **boolean expression** is an expression which evaluates to a `boolean` value of `true` or `false`.

The simplest boolean expressions are the `boolean` literal values themselves, `true` and `false`. Next in line are the identifiers of `boolean` variables, which evaluate to the value of said variables.

### Relational Operators

Java includes **relational operators** which return `true` or `false` depending on the values of their operands:

**OPERATOR** | **Math**  | **SAMPLE EXPRESSION** | **VALUE**
:----------: |:---------:| :-------------------: | :-------:
`<`          |<          | `x < y`               | `true` if `x` is less than `y`; `false` otherwise
`<=`         |≤          | `x <= y`              | `true` if `x` is less than or equal to `y`; `false` otherwise
`==`         |=          | `x == y`              | `true` if `x` equals `y`; `false` otherwise
`!=`         |≠          | `x != y`              | `true` if `x` does not equal `y`; `false` if `x` does equal `y`
`>=`         |≤          | `x >= y`              | `true` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`; `false` otherwise
`>`          |>          | `x > y`               | `true` if `x` is greater than `y`; `false` otherwise

Since relational operators evaluate to boolean values, they can be used to form boolean expressions.

<a name="q1"></a>**[EXERCISE 1](#a1)** Variables `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` are defined as follows:

```java
int a = 1;
byte b = -7;
float c = 8.0f;
double d = 1.0;
```

Evaluate each of the following boolean expressions

1. `a < b`
2. `a < d`
3. `a <= d`
4. `a == d`
5. `b == d`
6. `d < c`
7. `a != a`
8. `a == a`
9. `Math.abs(b) > Math.abs(d)`
10. `d >= a`
11. `-a * b == 7.0f`

### Boolean Operators

Java also includes **boolean operators**, which allow calculation of `boolean` values using boolean logic. Each boolean operator takes boolean expressions as operands, and outputs a boolean value based on the values of those expressions. In the following table, `a` and `b` are both assumed to be placeholders for boolean values or for boolean expressions.

| **OPERATOR** | **MEANING** | **SAMPLE EXPRESSION** | **VALUE**
| :----------: | :---------: | :-------------------: | :-------:
| `&&`         | *and*       | `a && b`              | `true` if `a` and `b` are both `true`; `false` otherwise
| `\|\|`       | *or*        | `a \|\| b `           | `false` if `a` and `b` are both `false`; `true` otherwise
| `!`          | *not*       | `!a`                  | `true` if `a` is `false`; `false` if `a` is `true`

If you refer to the [Java 8 operator precedence](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/COMP_150_LAB_2_JAVA_FUNDAMENTALS/blob/master/figures/operatorPrecedence.png) you'll see that, when evalutating logical expressions, first *not* operations (`!`) are performed from right to left, then *and* (`&&`) operations from left to right, and finally *or* (`||`) from left to right. Of course, parenthesis can be used to specify a different order.

Boolean operations occur after arithmetic and comparison operations.

<a name="q2"></a>**[EXERCISE 2](#a2)** The variables `x`, `y` and `z` are defined by:

```java
boolean x = true;
boolean y = false;
boolean z = false;
```

Evaluate each of the following boolean expressions:

1. `true || false`
2. `y || x`
3. `false || y`
4. `true && true`
5. `x && y`
6. `y || z`
7. `x || y && z`
8. `x || (y && z)`
9. `(x || y) && z`
10. `!x`
11. `!y`
12. `!x || x`
13. `!(x || x)`
14. `!y || !x && z`
15. `(!y || !x) && z`

<a name="q3"></a>**[EXERCISE 3](#a3)** The variables `a`, `b` and `c` are defined as follows:

```java
int x = 5;
int y = 0;
int z = 5;
```

Write boolean expressions which are equivalent to each of the following. Then, evaluate them.

1. `x` is at most `5` and at least `0`.
2. `x` and `y` are both at least `0`.
3. The sum of `y` and `7` is greater than `x`.
4. At least one of the following is true:
	* `x` plus `5` equals `11`.
	* The average of `x` and `y` is at least `3`.
	* `z` is positive.

### DeMorgan's Laws

Check out [DeMorgan's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws) for rules to help simplify boolean expressions. Note that the laws are laws of mathematics, not of Java, so the symbols used for the *and*, *or* and *not* (or *negation*) operators are different, but defined near the top of the article.

DeMorgan's Laws are essentially distribution of negation over parenthesized boolean expressions. They are:

* `!(a || b)` is equivalent to `!a && !b`
* `!(a && b)` is equivalent to `!a || !b`

The rules can be derived quickly. Consider `!(a || b)`. This expression is true if and only if `a || b` is false. `a || b` is true if and only if either `a` or `b` is true, so `!(a || b)` is only true if and only if both `a` and `b` are false, i.e. `!a && !b` is true.

Try to reason through the second law.

### Short-Circuit Evaluation

When boolean operations are evaluated, the values of input expressions are only calculated if necessary; unnecessary evaluations are skipped. For instance, in the expression `a && b`, if `a` is `false` then `b` won't be evaluated because `a && b` is necessarily `false` regardless of `b`'s value. Similarly, when evaluating `a || b` if `a` is `true` then `b`'s value isn't needed to determine that `a || b` is `true`.

One benefit of short-circuit evaluation: if an object may or may not be `null`, you can check if it is `null` and access it in the same boolean expression without running into *NullReferenceException*s. For example, the following boolean expression will not lead to an exception even if `myString` is `null`:

```java
myString != null && myString.length() > 0
```

## `if`/`else`

`if` and `else` statements can be used together with boolean expressions to select which blocks to run. We'll start our discussion of `if` and `else` with an example:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class MyClass
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Scanner scan = new Scanner( System.in );
		
		System.out.println("Enter an integer : ");
		long userInput = scan.nextLong();
		
		if (userInput > 10)
		{
			System.out.println("Your input was greater than 10.");
		}
		else
		{
			System.out.println("Your input was not greater than 10.");
		}
	}
}
```

The program above prompts the user for an integer, and stores their response in a variable called `userInput`. It then prints out a message, telling the user whether their input was greater than 10 or not.

<a name="q4"></a>**[EXERCISE 4](#a4)** Edit the program above to tell the user whether their response equals 10 instead of telling them whether it is greater than 10.

<a name="q5"></a>**[EXERCISE 5](#a5)** If the two printed `String`s in the conditional blocks above are switched, what happens? Does the value of the printed `String`s affect the flow of control? Does the accuracy of printed `String`s affect program execution? Does the compiler ensure that the printed messages align with the conditions under which they are printed (i.e. that they make sense or are accurate)?

### <a name="if"></a> `if` Statements

The simplest `if` statements look like: `if ( <boolean_expression> ) { <true_block> }`.

If the boolean expression in the parenthesis is true, then the statements in the true block are executed; otherwise they are not. In the snippet below, `x` has value `5`. So, when the `if` statement's boolean expression, `x == 5`, is evaluated, it evaluates to `true`. Because the boolean expression is true, the print statement in the true block runs.

```java
int x = 5;
if (x == 5)
{
	System.out.println("mmhmmm");
}
```

If the boolean expression is `false`, then the true block does not run. The program below does not print anything to the console:

```java
int x = 6;
if (x == 5)
{
	System.out.println("mmhmmm");
}
```

### `if`/`else` Statements

An `if` statement can include a second block, called the `else` block, with instructions to execute if the boolean expression is `false`:

```java
if ( <boolean_expression> )
{
	<true_block>
}
else
{
	<false_block>
}
```

The `else` keyword precedes the false block, i.e. the instructions to execute if the boolean expression is `false`. We can expand the example `if` statement above to include an `else`:

```java
int x = <int_literal>;
if (x == 5)
{
	System.out.println("mmhmmm");
}
else
{
	System.out.println("nuh uh");
}
```

Here if the value assigned to `x` is `5`, then the message "mmhmmm" is printed; otherwise "nuh uh" is printed.

In an `if` statement, the block(s) which may or may not be executed depending on the value(s) of boolean expression(s) are called **conditional blocks**. This is because they are blocks whose contained instructions are only executed if specific conditions (specifically, those defined in the boolean expression) are met.

<a name="q6"></a>**[EXERCISE 6](#a6)** Write a program which asks the user if they would like a free milkshake. If the user responds with `yes`, print out an appropriate message (e.g. "Ok, here's your milkshake!"). Otherwise, assume they said `no` in some way or another and print out an appropriate message.

### Statement Nestability

If statements are structured and interpreted in the following form: `if ( <boolean_expression> ) <statement> else <statement>`.

As shown above, the trailing `else <statement>` is optional. Recall that a block can be used wherever a statement can; in the examples above, the two `<statement>`s were blocks.

Because `if` statements are a type of statement, the `<statement>` slots above could be `if` statements. In other words, `if` statements are **nestable**; one `if` statement can be a part of (i.e. can be **nested in**) another `if` statement. This means that chains of `if` statements can be made as described in the next section.

### `if`/`else if`/`else` Chains

When the `<statement>` trailing the `else` keyword is, itself, an `if` statement, you end up with something like this:

```java
if ( <boolean_expression> )
{
	...
}
else if ( <boolean_expression> )
{
	...
}
else
{
	...
}
```

Consider executing a program like the one above. If the first boolean expression is `true`, then the first block is entered and executed. Then, an `else` is reached, but because the corresponding `if`'s boolean expression was `true`, the `<statement>` trailing the `else` is not executed. In the program above, this `<statement>` is an `if` statement with an `else` of its own, all of which is not executed.

In other words, in a chain of `if`/`else if` statements, only one `true` block will be entered.

Consider this example:

<a name="doorguard"></a>

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class DoorGuard
{
    static String CURRENT_PASSWORD = "password123";
    static String OLD_PASSWORD = "password";

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner( System.in );
        System.out.println("What's the password?");
        String userResponse = keyboard.next();

        if ( userResponse.equals(CURRENT_PASSWORD) )
        {
            System.out.println("Welcome back!");
        }
        else if ( userResponse.equals(OLD_PASSWORD) )
        {
            System.out.println("That's the old password...");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("Get lost!");
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that the boolean expressions above don't use the relational operators; the instead make calls to the `userResponse` `String`'s `equals` method. This is because `String`s are objects, not primitives, so the `==` operator would check if they are the **same object** (i.e. if they reference the same location in memory); we want to check if they contain the same characters, which is defined in the `String` class's `equals` method. We will discuss this in much more detail in the next lab; for now just know that the `String.equals` method compares two `String`s and returns `true` if they contain the same sequence of characters.

<a name="q7"></a>**[EXERCISE 7](#a7)** What happens if the user enters the current password in the example above? What if they enter the old password? What if they enter something else entirely?

<a name="q8"></a>**EXERCISE 8** Use the debugger to trace the program above (i.e. go through it line by line) with different inputs. When you're sure you understand why the lines being executed are being executed, you're ready to move on.

### `if` Statements, Blocks, and Nestability

The conditional blocks in `if` statements are, well, blocks; they can contain a sequence of statements. These contained statements can also be `if` statements (or any other type of statement). For example, the program below consists of an `if` statement whose conditional blocks contain more `if` statements.

<a name="FreeJacket"></a>

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class FreeJacket
{
    final static String YES_RESPONSE = "yes";
    final static String NO_RESPONSE = "no";

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner( System.in );
        String userResponse;

        System.out.println("Are you cold? (yes / no)");
        userResponse = keyboard.next();

        if ( userResponse.equals(YES_RESPONSE) )
        {
            System.out.println("Would you like a FREE JACKET? (yes / no)");
            userResponse = keyboard.next();
            if ( userResponse.equals(YES_RESPONSE) )
            {
                System.out.println("Here ya go!");
            }
            else if ( userResponse.equals(NO_RESPONSE) )
            {
                System.out.println("Who likes comfort anyway?");
            }
            else
            {
                System.out.println("\"yes\" or \"no\" ... ");
            }
        }
        else if ( userResponse.equals(NO_RESPONSE) )
        {
            System.out.println("Liar! Do you want a FREE JACKET? (yes / no)");
            userResponse = keyboard.next();
            if ( userResponse.equals(YES_RESPONSE) )
            {
                System.out.println("I knew you were cold...");
            }
            else if ( userResponse.equals(NO_RESPONSE) )
            {
                System.out.println("But it's free...");
            }
            else
            {
                System.out.println("\"yes\" or \"no\" ... ");
            }
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("\"yes\" or \"no\" ... ");
        }
    }
}
```

<a name="q9"></a>**EXERCISE 9** Read the program above. Theorize about how it should behave. When you believe you know what it will do in any case (i.e. with any sequence of user inputs) step through it with the debugger to test your understanding.

<a name="q10"></a>**[EXERCISE 10](#a10)** Write a program which prompts the user for two integer values `x` and `y`, denoting coordinates on the 2D Cartesian plane. Use nested `if` statements to tell them which quadrant their coordinates are in or which axis they are on.

## The Conditional Operator

The conditional operator (also known as the ternary operator) is to expressions what the `if` statement is to statements. With it, an expression can be made to have one value if a condition is true, and another if that condition is false.

We'll introduce the ternary operator with an example. Consider the following snippet:

```java
int x;

if (condition)
{
	x = 1;
}
else
{
	x = 0;
}	
```

In the snippet above, `x` is set to 1 if the variable `condition` is true, and is set to 0 otherwise. This snippet can be rewritten in one line using the conditional operator:

```java
int x = (condition ? 1 : 0);
```

The parenthesis in the statement above are unnecessary, but have been included for readability. The expression `condition ? 1 : 0` evaluates to 1 if `condition` is true, and 0 otherwise.

The ternary operator is written in the form:

```java
<boolean_expr> ? <true_expr> : <false_expr>
```

If the boolean expression is true, then the true expression is returned. Otherwise, the false expression is returned.

Like `if` statements, ternary operations are nestable. Any of the three component expressions of the ternary expression might be ternary expressions themselves.
For example:

```java
String season = temperature > 80 ? "Summer" :
                temperature > 70 ? "Spring" : 
                temperature > 60 ? "Fall"   :
                "Winter";
```

The snippet above sets the `season` string to `"Summer"` if `temperature > 70`, sets it to `"Spring"` if `temperature > 60` (assuming `temperature` was not greater than 70), and so on. Note that the expression is on multiple lines solely for readability's sake, and they could all be on one long ugly line instead as far as functionality is concerned.

You can think of the question mark as the `if`, only instead of coming before the condition it comes after the condition, and think of the colon as the `else`.

It is never **necessary** to use a ternary operator. Anything that can be done by the ternary operator can be done with an `if` statement, albeit less concisely. The converse is not true; `if` statements can do much more than ternaries can. Neither is faster in terms of runtime, though arguably the ternary is faster in terms of time spent typing. So, when should you use the ternary operator? Only when it improves readability. 

## `while` Loops

Sometimes it is necessary to repeat an action multiple times. This can be done with a **loop**. There are several types of loops in Java. The simplest type of loop is the `while` loop. `while` loops look like this:

```java
while ( <boolean_expression> )
{
	<loop_body>
}
```

As long as the boolean expression, called the **loop condition** remains `true`, the loop will keep repeating the statements in the **loop body**. The loop essentially works as follows:

1. Evaluate the loop condition.
2. If the loop condition is `true`, execute the instructions in the loop body, then start over on step 1.
3. Otherwise, resume execution on the line after the loop body.

Each repetition of the instructions in the loop body is called an **iteration**. To **iterate** is to go through an iteration.

The snippet below should iterate 10 times; it should print out the numbers `0` through `9`.

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10)
{
	System.out.println(i);
	++i;
}
```

A minor inaccuracy has been made above. A `while` statement doesn't necessarily need a block for its contents; it can look like this:

```java
while ( <boolean_expression> ) <statement>
```

Generally, when the loop body consists of a single statement, programmers will still use a block for readability's sake. If there is more than one statement in the loop body, then a block must be used.

<a name="q11"></a>**EXERCISE 11** Create a simple program with the the while loop above in its main method in order to step through it with the debugger and observe the behavior of the `while` loop.

<a name="q12"></a>**[EXERCISE 12](#a12)** Determine what value `i` has in the snippet above after the loop ceases iteration.

<a name="q13"></a>**EXERCISE 13** Consider `while` loop in the snippet below:

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 100)
{
	if (i % 2 == 0)
	{
		System.out.println(i + " is odd!");
	}
	++i;
}
```

What should the snippet above print? Are the printed messages accurate? What value should `i` have after the loop terminates? Test your answers to this question by creating a minimal program to run the snippet above.

<a name="q14"></a>**[EXERCISE 14](#a14)** Like `if` statements, `while` loops (and other loop types) can be nested, because they can appear wherever a statement can appear. Write a program that uses a nested `while` loop to print a pattern like the one below, with a number of lines specified by the user:

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

A sample run might look like:

```
Enter a positive integer > 7

*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * * *
```

### Infinite Loops

When you run a program and it *just keeps running* but never seems to do anything, or prints a message over and over in the console, you are likely stuck in an **infinite** or **endless** loop. These occur not just in `while` loops, but also in the other types of loops that we'll discuss further on. Inifinite loops occur if the loop condition remains true forever. This might happen if the variables in the loop condition are untouched by the loop body.

Consider the following loop:

```java
boolean a = true;
while (a)
{
	System.out.println("Just keep swimming...");
}
```

The loop above will keep printing the contained message **forever**, because `a` never becomes false.

One common, sneaky cause of infinite loops is a misplaced semicolon:

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10);
{
	i++;
}
```

The loop above has an extra semicolon; `while (i < 10);` should be `while (i < 10)`. This causes it to loop infinitely. Recall, a `while` loop is, at its core, this:

```java
while ( <boolean_expression> ) <statement>
```

In the `while` statement `while (i < 10);`, the trailing `;` is treated as an entire statement (one which does nothing). It occupies the entirety of the loop body. This loop essentially reads "while `i` is less than 10, do nothing", so nothing is done and `i` remains less than 10. The block `{ i++; }` following the loop is not the loop body, but instead an isolated block which would be run once if the preceeding infinite loop ever finished.

The common error above is a frustrating one. It is difficult to detect unless you already know what you're looking for. It is one of the errors that causes novice programmers to spend **hours or days** looking for an error in their logic, only to discover it was one sneaky semicolon.

I'd like to take this opportunity for a friendly reminder: programming is full of unexpected delays and headaches, many of which lead to a facepalm when their causes are discovered. When something like this happens to you: Don't beat yourself up. Don't question whether you're cut out to be a programmer. We've all done this, multiple times in multiple different ways. Each time you make a mistake like this, it is a learning experience whose frustration will ensure that you don't make that particular mistake again. 

When you're stuck and frustrated, never hesitate to ask for help, to take a walk, or to verbally abuse a rubber duck. The first is your right as a student and my joy as a teacher. The second two are proven debugging methods which have endured the test of time.

## `do while` Loops

The `do while` loop is very similar to the `while` loop. There are two differences. The first difference is in how the loop itself is written. A `do while` loop is written like this:

```java
do {
	<loop_body>
} while ( <boolean_expression> );
```

The second difference is that the `while` loop checks the loop condition before the first iteration, where the `do while` loop does not. In other words, a `while` loop can iterate 0 times if the loop condition is initially `false`, but a `do while` loop will **always** iterate at least once.

Anything that can be done with a `do while` loop can also be done with a `while` loop. The `do while` loop above could be written identically with a `while` loop like this:

```java
<loop_body>
while ( boolean_expression )
{
	<loop_body>
}
```

Sometimes, a loop body must iterate at least once, and it is easier (more concise) to write a `do while` loop. For example, loops are often used to get valid user inputs with the following sequence of events:

* prompt the user for a response
* read the user's response
* validate the user's response (check if it is valid)
* if the user's response is invalid, start over
* if the user's response is valid, continue

Consider for example the `UserWrangler` class:

<a name="UserWrangler"></a>

```java
/*
    The UserWrangler class will define methods to facilitate console interactions
    with the user (prompting, interpreting responses, validating responses...).
 */

import java.util.Scanner;

class UserWrangler
{
    final static String YES_RESPONSE = "yes";
    final static String NO_RESPONSE = "no";
    final static Scanner keyboard = new Scanner( System.in );

    static boolean getYesNoResponse(String prompt)
    {
        String userResponse;

        // repeatedly ask the user for a response (and tell them what their options are)
        // until that idiot figures out how to type "yes" or "no" ;)
        do {
            System.out.println(prompt + " (" + YES_RESPONSE + " / " + NO_RESPONSE + ")");
            userResponse = keyboard.next();
        } while ( !(userResponse.equals(YES_RESPONSE) || userResponse.equals(NO_RESPONSE)) );

        return userResponse.equals(YES_RESPONSE);
    }
}
```

At the moment, the class above contains a single method, called `getYesNoResponse`. It takes as an argument a `String`, storing the prompt (i.e. what to print to request information from the user). It returns a `boolean` value; `true` if the user enters "yes" and `false` if the user enters "no". It allows a programmer to ask the user a yes or no question, and be given the result as a `boolean` with a single method call.

<a name="q15"></a>**EXERCISE 15** Use the client below to step through `UserWrangler.getYesNoResponse` with the Debugger. When you're sure you understand how it works, you're ready to move on.

```java
class Client
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        boolean userYesNoResponse;

        while (true)
        {
            userYesNoResponse = UserWrangler.getYesNoResponse("ARA YA READY, KIDS!?");
            if (userYesNoResponse)
            {
                System.out.println("OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!");
            }
            else
            {
                System.out.println("oh...");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<a name="q16"></a>**[EXERCISE 16](#a16)** How many times does the loop in the client above iterate (assuming the user keeps providing inputs)?

## `for` Loops

`for` loops are another loop variant. Anything that can be done with a `for` loop can also be done with a `while` loop, but in some circumstances `for` loops provide more concision.

`for` loops are structured as follows:

```java
for (<initializing_statement> ; <boolean_expression> ; <end_of_iteration_statement>)
{
	<loop_body>
}
```	

`for` loops function much like `while` loops do, but come with a bit more of the setup encased in the statement syntax. The three statements in the `for` loop's parenthesis are as follows:

* `<initializing_statement>` : executed before the first iteration. Any declarations made are made in the scope of the loop, functionally, even though they don't appear in the block.
* `<boolean_expression>` : evaluated before each iteration; if `true`, keep looping; if `false`, stop looping.
* `<end_of_iteration_statement>` : executed after each iteration, before evaluating the boolean expression for the next iteration.

Consider, for example, the while loop from above:

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 10)
{
	System.out.println(i);
	++i;
}
```

A (nearly) identical `for` loop can be constructed using the same initial setup, loop condition, and end-of-loop statement:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
{
	System.out.println(i);
}
```

These two loops are identical in output; they both print the same numbers. There is a  difference, however. The `while` loop example declares `i` outside of the scope of the loop, so `i` still exists outside of the loop (it has a value of `10` when the loop completes). The `for` loop, on the other hand, declares `i` inside the scope of the loop, so `i` doesn't exist after the loop finishes iterating.

<a name="q18"></a>**EXERCISE 18** Try to print `i` after the `while` loop above. What happens? Do the same for the `for` loop above. What happens then?

<a name="q19"></a>**[EXERCISE 19](#a19)** Modify the `for` loop above so it behaves exactly like the `while` loop  above it (so `i` is still accessible afterwards).

## `break` and `continue`

A `break` statement can be used to stop a loop, without finishing the current iteration. Consider this snippet:

```java
int i = 0;
while (true)
{
	if (i == 10)
	{
		break;
	}
	System.out.println(i);
	++i;
}
```

Note that in the loop above, the loop condition is simply `true`. This means that, in theory, the loop could keep iterating forever. It will only stop iterating if it encounters a `break` statement or a `return` statement.

`i` starts at `0`, and is incrememented by `1` at the end of each iteration with `++i;`; eventually, it will be `10`, at which time the `if` condition `i == 10` will be `true`, and the `break;` statement will execute. When this happens, the `while` loop ceases looping without finishing the current iteration.

<a name="q20"></a>**EXERCISE 20** What is the first number printed by the loop above? What is the last? Verify by running.

A `continue` statement will cause the loop to start iteration again from the beginning of the loop body if the loop condition is still `true`. In other words, the `continue` statement ends the current iteration, but allows the loop to continue onto the next iteration.

```java
boolean flag = false;
for (int i = 0; i < 11; flag = !flag )
{
	++i;
	if (flag)
	{
		continue;
	}
	System.out.println(i);
}
```

The loop above starts `i` at `0` and increments `i` by `1` at the beginning of each iteration, so eventually the loop condition `i < 11` will be `false`. In each iteration, if `flag` is true then the loop body starts over; otherwise, the loop body continues to print `i` before starting over. At the end of each iteration, the value of `flag` is negated; if it was true, it becomes false and vice-versa.

In the loop above, the variable called `flag` was named this for a reason. **Flag variables** are (generally boolean) variables used to track conditions for looping and/or selection, generally throughout the iteration of a loop. You will need to use flag variables in several of your lab tasks. In at least one lab task, you'll need to use several flag variables.

<a name="q21"></a>**EXERCISE 21** What values are printed by the loop above? Verify by running. If you're not sure why one or more of the values is printed, trace the loop with the debugger.

## `switch`

`switch` statements can be used to when a `byte`, `short`, `int`, `char` or `String` expression has one of a finite number of values and the action taken that needs to be taken depends on that value.

Essentially, the `switch` takes as input an expression with one of these types, and performs the corresponding `case` associated with the expression's value.

In the following example, the `dayToInt` takes as an argument the name of a week, and outputs 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, etc.

<a name="dateUtils"></a>

```java
class DateUtils
{
    static int dayToInt(String dayName)
    {
        int dayInt;
        switch (dayName)
        {
            case "Sunday":
                dayInt = 1;
                break;
            case "Monday":
                dayInt = 2;
                break;
            case "Tuesday":
                dayInt = 3;
                break;
            case "Wednesday":
                dayInt = 4;
                break;
            case "Thursday":
                dayInt = 5;
                break;
            case "Friday":
                dayInt = 6;
                break;
            case "Saturday":
                dayInt = 7;
                break;
            default:
                dayInt = 0;
        }

        return dayInt;
    }
}
```

Note the `break` statements in each case. The `switch` is named aptly; once it encounters its input value, it "turns on", and continues executing not just the case with its input value, but also any subsequent cases. The `break` statements cause only one case to be executed. There are situations in which it is useful to let more than one case evaluate. For example, this functionality allows multiple cases which should have the same contents to be written "together". For instance, the "Sunday" case could be made to allow "sunday" and "SUNDAY" as inputs as well like this:

```java
case "Sunday":
case "sunday":
case "SUNDAY":
    dayInt = 1;
    break;
```

<a name="q22"></a>**EXERCISE 22** What is the output of the `dayToInt` method above if the `dayName` argument is not the name of a day of the week? Verify by running.

<a name="q23"></a>**EXERCISE 23** Create a client class to test the `dayToInt` method. You should ensure that it outputs the correct value for every day of the week, and for a variety of invalid inputs.

### `switch` and `if` Statements

You've likely noticed that anything that can be done with a `switch` can also be done with an `if`/`else`. If the number of possibilities is sufficiently large, the `switch` is faster. However, each possibility in an `if`/`else` chain or a `switch` must be typed "by hand" and if that number is large enough for its effect on performance to be relevant, you should probably be organizing the selection a different way.

Generally, if a `switch` can be used then the decision to use a `switch` or an `if`/`else` chain comes down to readability in context and the preference of the programmer. Often there isn't an option; the boolean expressions in the `if`/`else` are more complex than simple equality checks, a `switch` isn't the right tool for the job.

## Strings

Strings are sequence of characters. The string elements are numbered, or **indexed**. The first character's index is 0, the second is 1, and so on. With the initialization `String myString = "Hello":`, the instantiated string is indexed as follows:

| **char**  | `'H'` | `'e'` | `'l'` | `'l'` | `'o'` |
| :-------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **index** | 0     | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |

### `charAt` Method

The individual characters of a string can be accessed with their indexes using the `charAt` method. With `myString` defined as above, `myString.charAt(1)` is the character `'e'`.

### `length` Method

Strings have a `length()` method, which can be accessed using the accessor operator. The `length()` returns the number of characters in the string; `myString.length()` is 5 above, because `"Hello"` is 5 characters long. Note that the largest index (4) is 1 less than the length. This is true for all non-empty strings; it is a side effect of the index starting at 0.

### Traversing Strings

Loops are often used to traverse strings (and other iterables like arrays) one element at a time. The following loops both do the same thing: print out each character in `myString` on its own line.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < myString.length(); i++)
{
    System.out.println(myString.charAt(i));
}
```

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < myString.length())
{
    System.out.println(myString.charAt(i));
    i++;
}
```

<a name="q24"></a>**[EXERCISE 24](#a24)** Write a client which prints out a string, one character at a time, backwards. Write a second version of this client which instead creates a new string which is the first string, reversed. This could be done with the `StringBuilder` class, but you should use loops here to practice instead; create an empty string, then go through the string that you want to reverse backward, using `charAt` to add each character to the new string.

### IndexOutOfBoundsException

If you try to index a string (or another iterable) with an index that it doesn't contain, an *IndexOutOfBounds* exception will be thrown. This happens if the index is negative, because indexing starts at 0, or if the index is larger than the maximum index in the string (1 less than its length).

<a name="q25"></a>**[EXERCISE 25](#a25)** In one of the loops above for traversing a string, replace the `i < myString.length()` with `i <= myString.length()`. Put your loop in a minimal program to run it, and verify that an *IndexOutOfBoundsException* is thrown. Why is it thrown? Which index is out of bounds?

### `substring` Method

It is sometimes necessary to get a "piece" of a string consisting of several contiguous characters i.e. a **substring**. This can be done with the `substring` method.

This method has two forms. The first form takes a single int argument, specifying the index of the first character in the substring. The returned substring will include all characters from the specified index to the end of the string. For example:

```
String myString = "Hello World!";
String mySubstring = myString.substring(2);
```

In the example above, `mySubstring` gets the characters in `myString` from index 2 to the end. The result is `"llo World!"`; index 2 is the third character, because indexing starts at 0.

The `substring` method can also specify an end index, specifying where the substring should end. It does not specify the index of the last substring element, but instead the index of the first excluded element; all indexes from the start index up to (but not including) the end index are in the substring. For example:

```
String myString = "Hello World!";
String mySubstring = myString.substring(2,7);
```

The substring picked out in the snipped above is `"llo W"`. The substring starts on index 2 (the first `'l'`) and ends just before index 7 (the `'o'` in "World").

<a name="q26"></a>**[EXERCISE 26](#a26)** Using the initialization `String myString = "Hello World!"`, write two `substring` calls. One should extract the word "Hello", and the other should extract "World!".

We will cover more string methods in the next lab. There are **a lot** of them. Check out the [API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html).

The loop will iterate infinitely. It starts with `while (true)`; the boolean expression `true` will never cease to be true, no matter how many times the loop iterates.

### <a name="a19"></a>**[EXERCISE 19](#q19)**

If we declare `i` outside of the `for` loop, then it exists outside of the scope of the `for` loop.

```java
int i = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
{
	System.out.println(i);
}
```

### <a name="a24"></a>**[EXERCISE 24](#q24)**

The following client:

```java
public class ReverseStringClient
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String myString = "Idk some string value that isn't a palindrome...";

        String reversedString = "";

        for (int i = myString.length()-1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
            reversedString += myString.charAt(i);
        }

        System.out.println("\"" + myString + "\"\n reversed is \n\"" + reversedString + "\"");
    }
}
```

has the following output:

```
"Idk some string value that isn't a palindrome..."
 reversed is 
"...emordnilap a t'nsi taht eulav gnirts emos kdI"

Process finished with exit code 0
```

### <a name="a25"></a>**[EXERCISE 25](#q25)**

Changing the loop condition to `i <= myString.length()` allows the loop to iterate when `i` is equal to `myString.length()`. Recall, the largest index in `myString` is 1 less than its length, because indexing starts at 0, so when the loop iterates with `i` equal to `myString.length()` and `i` is used to index `myString`, it is out of the bounds of `myString`'s indices.

### <a name="a26"></a>**[EXERCISE 26](#q26)**

With the initialization `String myString = "Hello World!";`, we can extract "Hello" with `myString.substring(0,5)`. The `'H'` is index 0, and the space is index 5.

"World!" can be extracted with `myString.substring(6)`. The `'W'` is index 6, and without an end index provided the substring goes to the end of the string.

# Lab Assignment

## Task 1

Rewrite the [`DoorGuard`](#doorguard) class to run in a loop. It should prompt the user for the password in a loop, telling them when their entries are incorrect, until the user enters the correct password, at which point it should print a message welcoming the user and then terminate.

## Task 2

* Add a `static` method to the [`UserWrangler`](#UserWrangler) class called `getMonthName` which
	* requires no arguments
	* prompts the user for the name of a month until the user enters a valid month name (use a loop)
	* returns the valid month name entered by the user (as a `String`)
* Add to the [`DateUtils`](#dateUtils) class. In it, create a `static` method called `monthToInt` which:
	* requires a String argument (the name of a month)
	* returns an `int` (1 for January, 2 for February, etc, 0 for invalid)
* Create a client class to test both `getMonthName` and `monthToInt` by using the output from `getMonthName` as the input for `monthToInt` and printing the resulting `int`

`switch`s also work with the accepted primitives' respective wrapper classes `Byte`, `Short`, `Integer` and `Character`, as well as with enumerated types (`enum`s) which we will discuss in a future lab.

## Task 3

Write a program which asks the user for a grade, in integer form, from 0 to 100.

If the user's response is negative or greater than 100, insult them.

Otherwise, use `if` / `else` statements to print out the letter grade corresponding to the user's input.

* 90 - 100 : A
* 80 - 89 : B
* 70 - 79 : C
* 60 - 69 : D
* 0 - 59 : F

Then, write a second version of the program which uses a `switch` instead of `if` `else`. (HINT: divide the user's response by 10)

## Task 4

### Part 1

Write a program much like that written in [Exercise 14](#q14), but which mirrors the printed shape to form a "bottom half". 

#### Part 1 Sample Run

```
Enter a positive integer > 7

*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
* 
```

### Part 2

Write a new version of your program from part 1 that alternates from row to row between asterisks and carrots.

#### Part 2 Sample Run

```
Enter a positive integer > 7

*
^ ^
* * *
^ ^ ^ ^
* * * * *
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
* * * * * * *
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
* * * * *
^ ^ ^ ^
* * *
^ ^
* 
```

### Part 3

Write a new version of your program from part 2 that prints out a "checkboard" pattern of asterisks and carrots. 

HINT: the first character on each row is the same as it was in part 2.

#### Part 3 Sample Run

```
Enter a positive integer > 7

*
^ *
* ^ *
^ * ^ *
* ^ * ^ *
^ * ^ * ^ *
* ^ * ^ * ^ *
^ * ^ * ^ *
* ^ * ^ *
^ * ^ *
* ^ *
^ *
* 
```

## Task 5

Write a program which prompts the user for a positive integer, and then prints a diamond pattern in which the number of asterisks on the middle line is equal to their entered integer. The example below is what should be printed if the user enters `3`.

```
  *
 * *
* * *
 * *
  * 
```

## Task 6

Write a program which reads an input file. It should assume that all values in the input file are integers written in decimal. Your program should read all integers from the file and print their sum, maximum value, minimum value, and average. Use [the `FileClient` class here](https://github.com/arewhyaeenn/OOP_CLASSES_OBJECTS_METHODS#fileClient) (from a previous reading) as an example. You'll need to create a file to be used as input to test your program, as well. Your program should work whether the integers are separated by spaces, new lines, tabs or a mix of the three (but it does not need to work with other delimiters, like commas). In other words, it should work as long as the integers are separated only by white space characters (this is what the `Scanner`'s `next<primitive>` functions do).

To convert individual integers written in the file from their string from to int form, find and use an appropriate method in the [`Integer`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html) wrapper class.

## Task 7

Write a program which takes a word as input and does as the sample runs below demonstrate:

```
Enter a word: word

w
wo
wor
word
 ord
  rd
   d
```

```
Enter a word: racecar

r
ra
rac
race
racec
raceca
racecar
 acecar
  cecar
   ecar
    car
     ar
      r
```

## Task 8

Write a program which prompts the user for a positive integer, and then prints out the prime factorization of their response.

Do not import anything other than the Scanner.

One way you might go about this using nested loops:

* Start a "factor" variable at 2
* In a loop:
	* repeatedly print the current factor, and divide the user input by it, until the user input is no longer divisible by the factor
	* increment the factor

This plan is by no stretch of the imagination efficient, but it does the job.

HINT: You can the modulus operator `%` to determine if one integer is divisible by another. If `a` is divisible by `b`, then `a % b` (the remainder of division of `a` by `b`) has what value?

### Sample Runs

```
Enter a positive integer > 144

The prime factorization of 144 is:
2 2 2 2 3 3
```

```
Enter a positive integer > 45

The prime factorization of 45 is:
3 3 5
```

## Task 9

Write a method which takes as input an integer, returns `true` if the integer is prime, and returns `false` otherwise. Do not import anything.

If the input is negative, 0 or 1, `false` should be returned.

If the input `x` is greater than 1, you can test if it is prime (inefficiently) by checking if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to half of `x`. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is prime; otherwise, it is not prime.

Your submission should also include the client that you use to test your method.

## Task 10

Write a method which takes as input an integer `n` and prints the first `n` prime numbers. Do not import anything; instead, use a loop and the method that you wrote in the previous task.

Your submission should include the client that you use to test your method.

## Task 11 (Optional)

Create a class called `StringUtils`. In it, create a `boolean` method called `isPalindrome` which takes a `String` in as an argument and outputs `true` if the input is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise.

A `String` is a palindrome if it is character-wise "symmetrical"; the first letter is the same as the last letter, the second is the same as the second-to-last, and so on.

Add to the `StringUtils` methods two more `boolean` methods called `isCapsLocked` and `isLowerCase`; they should each take a `String` as an argument, and should return `true` if every letter in the `String` is capital or lower case, respectively, and `false` otherwise. Non-alphabetic characters should be treated as neither capital nor lowercase.

Finally, write a client class to test these methods. Your client class should prompt the user for inputs in an infinite loop. For each input, the program should check if the input is the value `"END"`, which should be used as a **sentinel** (i.e. a value denoting that a particular action should be taken) denoting that the program should terminate. If the input is anything other than `"END"`, the client should tell the user whether their input was a palindrome, whether it was all capital letters, and whether it was all lowercase letters.

After the user enters the sentinel `"END"`, the program should tell the user:

* How many palindromes they entered
* How many caps-locked inputs they entered
* How many lowercase inputs they entered

It should then terminate.
